# Rift-model
This Rift software is an early version from the Rift2Ridge project . This software was developed at the MARUM Center for Marine Environmental Sciences, University of Bremen.
It solves the momentum, mass and energy conservation equations in a Lagrangian framework. The code originally branched from MILAMIN finite element solvers (Dabrowski et al., G-cubed, 2008). The code has been used to addressed tectonic, sedimentary, and surface processes during rifting (e.g. Pérez-Gussinyé et al., 2020, Andrés-Martínez et al., 2019, Ros et al., 2017, Andrés-Martínez et al., 2015). This uploaded version is modified from Ruilong 's work, with added code sections for multiphase extension functionality and plotting programs.
